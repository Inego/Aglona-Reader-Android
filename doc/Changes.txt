Added this changes.txt file to make tracking more transparent (assuming it's kept up to date)
Changed version to 1.0.2.4
Advanced popup and TTS now terminate upon SCROLL actions
Brightness control is now same as divider, not central 1/3 of screen
Doubled width of "FINGERTIP" from .1 to .2 inch providing wider area for divider drag or brightness control.
Brightness control sound effect now rises/falls with brightness change
Reversed brightness control so up is brighter, down is darker
Reformatted MainActivity.java, ParallelTextView.java and ParallelTextData.java for clarity and deleted commented-out code.
Reconfigured some areas of code marked as "probable bug" or "redundant" or "unused" by Android Studio as recommended by AS.
Corrected problem where spoken text did not match popup under some conditions.
Corrected problem of grayed-out fragments at end of screen containing entire sentences.
Moved variable "opstate" from ParallelTextData.java to ParallelTextView.java since this is (now?) the only location it is used from.

TODO:
- Add TTS speed and pitch settings to prefs (currently controlled by system settings)
- Add TTS to normal and alternating display modes
- Fix normal mode color spillover at top of screen
- Improve file navigation; sometimes directories appear to be unavailable
- Improve startup time of TTS when language changes, possibly by preloading a second thread
- Divider should be horizontal on vertical tablet orientation, currently vertical on all orientations
- Analyze possible overuse of pTD, etc., to import/export context
- Investigate small screen slider sound effect performance; possibly we need a different metric to time sound effect calls

    1. Commented many areas of code flagged as unused and applied several code
    logic changes as recommended by Android Studio (Analyze-->Inspect).
    2. Added Android TTS (Text To Speech) to Advanced Reading mode.  When a
    section is tapped, its translation is shown (as before) and it is spoken
    in its untranslated language.  Toasts appear for error conditions. This
    function may be disabled entirely via Settings.
    3. Modified "Brightness" control to respond to vertical swipes on central vertical 1/3 of
    screen only.  Rest of screen (and entire screen in Alternating and
    Advanced modes) scrolls text back/forward by line in response to vertical swipes.
    4. Added sound effects for page turn, scroll, Brightness control, program
    (re)start, which may be disabled via Settings.
    5. Corrected problem (in PTV) which caused font size control to stop working if
    pinch control was used past smallest font.
    6. Changed version to 1.0.2.3

    I've made several tweaks to provide a margin
    between the text and edges of the screen.  All changes
    commented as <crw>.

    Reworked user interaction mechanics.
    1. Menu can be called by long tap (as it was inaccesible on devices without hardware menu bu
tton)
    2. Font size is controlled by two-finger scale gesture
    3. Brightness is controlled by vertical swiping.
    4. Pages are changed by horizontal swiping or volume buttons.
